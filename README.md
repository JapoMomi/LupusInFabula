# Lupus in Fabula

The aim of this project is to develop a web application that will help the game-master during the game Lupus in Fabula (
the basic rules of which are explained below).
This app will help the game-master to keep track of what happens during the game, e.g. what role each player has, what
happened during the night (which player is dead) or which player is voted during the day to be eliminated.
